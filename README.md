## Introduction
This project was completed as part of a 15-credit Portfolio project at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. My goal was to combine learning assembly language with game development. I chose the Atari 2600 console as my platform because it requires assembly coding due to its hardware limitations. Additionally, there is a wealth of online documentation and tutorials available for the Atari 2600.


## Objective
While my degree included extensive C++ training, I wanted to deepen my understanding of low-level programming concepts by learning assembly language. The aim of this project was to immerse myself in an environment that required assembly coding, making the Atari 2600 a suitable choice due to its unique constraints.


## Game Description
The game revolves around a teenager who frequently plays with fireworks, much to the annoyance of a neighbor who owns a bow and arrows. The neighbor attempts to shoot down the fireworks while the teenager is trying to ignite them. The goal is to see how many fireworks the teenager can successfully set off while avoiding the neighbor's arrows.

## Development Process
I prepared for this project by studying six chapters from "Digital Design and Computer Architecture" by Sarah Harris and completing the online course "Learn Assembly Language by Making Games for the Atari 2600."

Using a template from the "Learn Assembly Language by Making Games for the Atari 2600" course as a foundation, I added new features, logic, and graphics to create a unique game experience.
