## Introduction
This project was made for the 15 credit Portfolio project held at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. My goal was to combine learning Assembly and create a game. I chose the Atari 2600 console as a platform, since it requires assembly coding due to its limitations, and it has well established online documentations, and tutorials.


## Objective
We had extensive C++ training in our degree, and to deepen our understanding of more low level concepts, I decided to learn assembly. The goal of this project was to put myself in an environment that requires assembly, which making a game for Atari 2600 is the perfect platform to do that due to its limitations.


## Game Description
A teenager is plays with fireworks all the time, and the neighbor who happens to own arrows is very frustrated about it. The neighbor decides to shoot down the fireworks while the teenager is trying to shoot them. How many fireworks can the teenager manage to successfully shoot, and avoid the remnence?

## Development Process
I used the following material to prepare for the project.

* I studied 6 chapters of the book "Digital Design and Computer Architecture" by Sarah Harris.
* I finished the online course "Learn Assembly Language by Making Games for the Atari 2600".


Then, I used the template that was used in the "Learn Assembly Language by Making Games for the Atari 2600" as a base, and added features, logic and graphics on to it by coding.
